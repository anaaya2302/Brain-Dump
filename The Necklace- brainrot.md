# The Necklace <br> ( more like noose but O.K )
## by Guy de Maupassant ( abridged version ) <br> - professionaly translated by Aanya and Anaaya
Mathilde Loisel was dummy thiccc (with 3 Cs) but, the universe had beef with her so she was the crotch goblin of clerks. She had no dowry, no expectations (the bar was literally on the floor) of bagging a sigma male fine shytt so, she completed her NPC arc and locked in with a smol clerk who was adulting at the Ministry of Public Instruction.<br><br>
Her fits were basic af cuz she was economically challenged. She thought she was in her flop era (emo vibes) when she should've been a block buster.<br><br>

She was in her mentally unwell era cuz she thought deserved to be y/n, slim-thick, 3'1 with her 10'9 billionaire mafia werewolf vampire CEO (zaddy) (fire emoji fire emoji).Her house had negative aura (-99999999 aura), someone really needed to tell her it was not that deep (fight me). She highkey wanted her house to give divorced Victorian energy (Pinterest PTSD). She was experiencing a lore drop. The sight of her chonky house elf (help) (dobby iykyk) aroused regrets in her (kinda like the ones my ex gave me). She high-key wanted to be 'the' hallway crush with all the lip-gloss lipped baddies.<br><br>

Every evening, she would activate chair protocol and plop down for dinner before the round table covered with a table cloth that had been there for 69 fortnite matches (no bathroom breaks) opposite her man (who was built like a tax return but she had married him anyway). He would uncover the soup-tureen (man, idek what that is) lowkey manifesting a bite that slapped harder than his emotional baggage. The cheugy man would SQUEAL with joy (sowwy) "Ah! The good pot-au-feu! Idk shit that slaps harder", whereas the ungrateful hoe, Mathilde Loisel, wanted him to just stfu (don't pmo).<br><br>

She felt like she had been ratioed irl. She had 0 robux and no fire fits (the audacity) but, her comfort was thinking that even a girlboss has her weak moments.<br><br>
She wasn't a girl's girl so her former homie (oomf), who was making BANK, pissed her tf off.<br><br>
But one dull, gray (fight me) evening is when our lore opened when her husband returned home with peak main character energy, holding a chonky chonky chonky chonklord envelope in his hand.<br>
"Here", he said, "is something 4 u"<br>
She yeeted the paper and snatched out a printed card.<br><br>
***"The Minister of Public Instruction and Mine. Georges Ramponneau*** (this guy's parents fs had unresolved beef with him. Like seriously, who names their kid that) ***request the honour of M. and Mine. Loisel's company at the palace of the ministry on Monday evening, January 18."*** (basically, rich ppl mumbo jumbo).
